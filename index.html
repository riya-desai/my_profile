         <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I joined ESSEC Business School in September 2019 as I was keen to discover the world of business. I have since then worked in multiple companies and have around 2 years of work experiences in a professional environment. I am organised and result oriented, this is how I was able to be able to work and gain experience while studying at ESSEC Business School full time. I have always aimed to grow holistically. This is where my interest in travels come in. I have traveled to most of the continents of the world to experience different cultures and to understand them. In August, I joined Teads for my 6 month internship where I found a team where we can indeed achieve wonders.

We also rescued a small puppy stuck in an abandoned fishing net. </p>
