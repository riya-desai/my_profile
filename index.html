         <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Born and brought up on a tiny island on the east coast of Africa, I have spent my whole life, on the seaside, building sand castles. Some might say it was paradise but I had other dreams. Dreams that I was adament on fulfilling. I wanted to travel and discover the world, the different wonders and cultures around the globe.
